# Cloak Integration Guide

This guide will walk you through the main steps of integrating Cloak into your system.

- Visit [Use cases](integration/use-cases) to learn about ways your system can leverage Cloak.
- Understand the main steps of using Cloak in your system: [Authenticating](integration/auth) with the Cloak RPC endpoint, [depositing funds](integration/deposits) from Scroll to Cloak, [making transfers](integration/transfers) between different accounts on Cloak, and [withdrawing funds](integration/withdrawals) from Cloak back to Scroll.
- See [Address book](integration/address-book) for a reference of the latest deployment addresses of the Cloak devnet.
- Visit the [FAQ](integration/faq) for troubleshooting.

Most code examples in these pages use Javascript with `ethers`.
However, Cloak is language-agnostic.
If your system uses a different programming language, reach out to discuss SDK support.
